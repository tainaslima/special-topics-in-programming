# Special Topics in Programming

> This repository contains all implementations made during the Special Topics in Programming (pt-br:"Tópicos Especiais em Programação") class, lectured by Professor Claudson Bornstein of Institute of Computing (previous Computer Science Department) at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. These class' codes are related with what were scheduled for 2021/1 school term. 

The program for this class consisted of weekly exercises taken from UVa Online Judge to practice what were learned during the course with some new content, mostly related to data structure and optimization. Most solutions were made in Python language and some of them in C++.
